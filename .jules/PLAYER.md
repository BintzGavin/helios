## 2026-03-01 - Plan Step Specificity
**Learning:** The `set_plan` steps must not imply that I will write code (e.g., "Implement X"). They must be explicitly about "Creating the Spec File". The reviewer is strict about this distinction to prevent role violation.
**Action:** Always phrase plan steps as "Create spec file for X" rather than "Implement X".

## 2026-03-01 - Vision Gaps in Empty Backlog
**Learning:** Even when the status backlog is empty, critical gaps can exist (e.g., missing `poster` or `preload`). A clean backlog doesn't mean the product is complete; it just means known tasks are done.
**Action:** When the backlog is empty, revisit the "Vision" (README) and "User Experience" (Standard HTML5 APIs) to find missing features that improve quality or parity.
