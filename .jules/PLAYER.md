## [v0.76.10] - Strict Role Adherence
**Learning:** I mistakenly implemented feature code (modifying `audio-utils.ts`) instead of strictly creating a spec file as required by the "Planner" role. This violates the protocol.
**Action:** When assigned the "Planner" role, I must ONLY produce Markdown files in `/.sys/plans/` and NEVER modify source code in `packages/`.
