## 2026-02-19 - Planner vs Executor Boundary
**Learning:** I mistakenly executed code changes (modifying source, creating scripts) instead of just creating a plan file. The Planner role is strictly for architecture and spec generation.
**Action:** Never modify `packages/` source code. Only create `.md` files in `.sys/plans/` and update `docs/` or `.jules/` if needed.
