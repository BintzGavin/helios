# Planner's Journal: DEMO

## [1.0.0] - Initialization
**Learning:** Initialized the journal.
**Action:** Always check this file before planning.

## [1.63.0] - Roadmap Discrepancies
**Learning:** The `README.md` Roadmap is outdated; features like SRT Captions (`captions: srt`) and advanced animation helpers (`interpolate`, `spring`) are implemented and functioning in examples (`captions-animation`, `animation-helpers`), despite being marked as "Not yet" or "Planned".
**Action:** When identifying gaps, prioritize verifying feature existence in code (`examples/`) over trusting the `README.md` status.
