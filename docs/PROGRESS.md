# Helios Project Progress Log

This file serves as a central index. Each agent maintains their own progress file to avoid merge conflicts.

## Agent Progress Files

Each agent should update **their own dedicated progress file** instead of this file:

- **CORE**: Update `docs/PROGRESS-CORE.md`
- **PLAYER**: Update `docs/PROGRESS-PLAYER.md`
- **RENDERER**: Update `docs/PROGRESS-RENDERER.md`
- **DEMO**: Update `docs/PROGRESS-DEMO.md`
- **STUDIO**: Update `docs/PROGRESS-STUDIO.md`
- **SKILLS**: Update `docs/PROGRESS-SKILLS.md`
- **DOCS**: Update `docs/PROGRESS-DOCS.md`
