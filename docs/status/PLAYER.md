- `<helios-player>` uses a modular architecture with `HeliosController` (Direct/Bridge) and `ClientSideExporter`.
- Client-side export supports explicit configuration via `export-mode`, `canvas-selector`, and `export-caption-mode` attributes.
- Supports specifying target export resolution via `export-width` and `export-height` attributes, enabling high-quality exports independent of player preview size.
- Supports exporting captions as `.srt` files (`export-caption-mode="file"`) or burning them into the video (`burn-in`).
- Supports **Synchronized Caption Styling**: Captions in the player match the export output (WYSIWYG), with configurable styling via CSS variables (`--helios-caption-scale`, `--helios-caption-bg`, etc.) and responsive font sizing.
- Supports sandboxed iframes and cross-origin usage via `postMessage` bridge.
- Includes visual feedback for loading and error states (connection timeouts).
- Supports variable playback speed via UI and Controller API.
- Implements Robust DOM Export using XMLSerializer and SVG foreignObject, including external stylesheets.
- Supports dynamic sizing via `width`/`height` attributes and `src` changes.
- Supports standard keyboard shortcuts (Space/K, F, Arrows) and Fullscreen toggle.
- Supports frame-by-frame navigation via `.` and `,` keys, and Shift modifier for 10-frame jumps.
- Supports Interactive Playback Range via keyboard shortcuts (`I`, `O`, `X`).
- Displays actionable error messages with "Dismiss" option for failed client-side exports.
- Supports Volume and Mute controls via UI and Bridge.
- Supports Audio Track Volume and Mute controls via Controller API and Bridge.
- **Audio Track UI**: Implements a dedicated Audio Menu in the player controls (toggled by '🎵' button) to mute/unmute and adjust volume for individual audio tracks.
- Supports caption rendering overlay with toggleable "CC" button.
- Supports WebM (VP9/Opus) client-side export via `export-format` attribute.
- Implements Standard Media API (play, pause, currentTime, events) for better interoperability.
- Client-side audio export respects `volume` and `muted` properties of audio elements.
- Client-side export (DOM mode) now inlines `<video>` elements as static images, ensuring they are visible in the exported output.
- Supports declarative data binding via `input-props` attribute (JSON string) and property, enabling dynamic composition updates.
- Supports `poster` and `preload` attributes. `preload="none"` defers iframe loading until the user interacts with the new "Big Play Button".
- Implements responsive controls using `ResizeObserver`, adapting UI layout for smaller widths (hiding volume/speed controls).
- Fully implemented Standard Media API properties (`src`, `autoplay`, `loop`, `controls`, `poster`, `preload`) as getters/setters on `HeliosPlayer`.
- Implemented `readyState` and `networkState` properties and standard lifecycle events (`loadstart`, `loadedmetadata`, `canplay`, etc.), aligning with HTMLMediaElement specifications.
- Implements Deep API Parity (`videoWidth`, `videoHeight`, `buffered`, `seekable`, `seeking`) to support integration with standard video wrappers.
- Implements `controlslist` attribute support (`nodownload`, `nofullscreen`) to customize UI visibility.
- Implements CSS Variables (custom properties) for theming the player UI (`--helios-controls-bg`, `--helios-accent-color`, etc.).
- Supports Native Loop via `setLoop` in Controller/Bridge, removing client-side loop hacks.
- Supports importing SRT and WebVTT captions via standard `<track kind="captions">` child elements and exposes standard `textTracks` / `addTextTrack` API.
- Supports `sandbox` attribute to customize iframe security flags (default: `allow-scripts allow-same-origin`).
- Implemented robust `load()` behavior that supports reloading the current `src` to facilitate programmatic retries.
- Visualizes markers on the timeline, allowing users to identify and seek to specific points of interest.
- Migrated client-side export to use `mediabunny`, replacing deprecated `mp4-muxer` and `webm-muxer`.
- Implemented persistence for `volume`, `playbackRate`, and `muted` properties, ensuring values set before connection are applied upon initialization.
- Implements Smart Controls: 'CC' button is hidden when no tracks are present, and 'Picture-in-Picture' button can be hidden via `disablepictureinpicture`.
- Supports auto-enabling of captions if a track is marked as `default`.
- Supports audio fade-in/out in client-side export via `data-helios-fade-in` and `data-helios-fade-out` attributes.
- Supports Shadow DOM Export: DOM-based client-side export now correctly captures Shadow DOM content (via Declarative Shadow DOM transformation), enabling support for Web Components in exports.
- Supports Environment Diagnostics UI: Implemented `diagnose()` method in `HeliosController` and a visible Diagnostics UI overlay in `<helios-player>` (toggled via `Shift+D`) to expose environment capabilities (WebCodecs, etc.) to the user.
- Supports Headless Audio Export: Client-side export now includes audio tracks manually injected into Helios state (`availableAudioTracks`), enabling headless audio rendering without DOM elements.
- Supports Dynamic Composition Updates: Exposes `setDuration`, `setFps`, `setSize`, and `setMarkers` via `HeliosController` (and Bridge), allowing host applications (like Studio) to update the composition structure dynamically.
- Supports Export Filename: Implemented `export-filename` attribute to allow specifying the filename for client-side exports.
- Supports Active Cues: Implemented `activeCues` property and `cuechange` event on `HeliosTextTrack` for Standard Media API parity.
- **Audio Metering**: Supports real-time audio metering via `startAudioMetering()` API and `audiometering` event, enabling visualization of audio levels (stereo/peak) in host applications.
- **Export API**: Exposes public `export()` method for programmatic control over client-side exports, supporting Video (MP4/WebM) and Snapshot (PNG/JPEG) formats.
- **Export Menu**: Implements a dedicated Export Menu in the player UI (replacing the direct export button action) to allow configuring format, resolution, filename, and captions before exporting or taking a snapshot.
