# Status: DEMO Domain

**Version**: 1.75.0

## Vision
The DEMO domain is responsible for:
1.  **Examples:** Providing clear, idiomatic usage examples for all supported frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, Vanilla).
2.  **E2E Testing:** Ensuring the rendering pipeline works across all configurations.
3.  **Build Config:** Maintaining the root `vite.config.js` and build scripts to support the examples.

## Blocked Items
- **⚠️ COORDINATION**: Promo video example (`examples/promo-video/`) currently renders black due to RENDERER bug in `SeekTimeDriver.ts` (GSAP timeline synchronization issue). RENDERER agent is fixing this - DEMO agent should verify the example works correctly after RENDERER completes the fix. See `docs/status/RENDERER.md` "Next Steps" for details.

## Active Tasks
- [2026-06-07] 🚧 Planned: Diagnostics Example - Create `examples/diagnostics` to demonstrate `Helios.diagnose()` and provide a runnable environment check.
