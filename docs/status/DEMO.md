# Status: DEMO Domain

**Current Version:** 1.62.0

## Vision
The DEMO domain is responsible for:
1.  **Examples:** Providing clear, idiomatic usage examples for all supported frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, Vanilla).
2.  **E2E Testing:** Ensuring the rendering pipeline works across all configurations.
3.  **Build Config:** Maintaining the root `vite.config.js` and build scripts to support the examples.

## Blocked Items
- [2026-01-30] Verification blocked: npm install fails due to workspace version mismatch (Renderer requires Core 2.10.0, but Core is 2.11.0). Cannot fix due to permissions.
