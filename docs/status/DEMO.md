# Agent DEMO Status

## Current Focus
Expanding examples and ensuring robust tooling.

## Completed
- Bootstrapped planning process.
- Generalized build tooling to support multi-page app (MPA) builds for examples.
- Added React Canvas example (`react-canvas-animation`).
- Updated render script to support selecting examples via CLI.

## Backlog
- Add DOM-based example (once Renderer supports it).
- Add more framework examples (Vue, Svelte).
- End-to-End verification (ongoing).
