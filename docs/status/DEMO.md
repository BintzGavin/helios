## Vision
To provide comprehensive, idiomatic examples for every major framework (React, Vue, Svelte, Vanilla) and robust end-to-end testing to ensure the Helios engine delivers on its "Use What You Know" promise.

## Current State
- **Vanilla JS**: ✅ `examples/simple-canvas-animation` exists and works.
- **React**: ❌ Missing.
- **Vue**: ❌ Missing.
- **Svelte**: ❌ Missing.
- **E2E Tests**: ❓ Need to verify coverage.

## Backlog
- [ ] Scaffold React Example (`examples/react-canvas-animation`)
- [ ] Scaffold Vue Example
- [ ] Scaffold Svelte Example
- [ ] Verify E2E tests for examples
