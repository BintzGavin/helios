# Renderer Agent Status

## Progress Log
- [2024-05-21] ✅ Completed: Refactor FFmpeg Arguments to Strategy - Moved FFmpeg input argument generation to RenderStrategy interface, allowing custom input formats (like WebCodecs streams) in the future.
- [2024-05-24] ✅ Completed: Enable Stateful Render Strategies - Added `prepare(page)` lifecycle method to `RenderStrategy` to support initialization (like WebCodecs) before rendering.
- [2026-02-18] ✅ Completed: Refactor FFmpeg Config - Fully decoupled FFmpeg argument generation by moving it to `RenderStrategy.getFFmpegArgs` and extracted `RendererOptions` to `types.ts` to prevent circular dependencies.
