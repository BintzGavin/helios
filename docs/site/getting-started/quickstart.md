# Quickstart

Helios Engine is a library for creating video-ready animations using web technologies. It allows you to build compositions using standard HTML, CSS, and Canvas (or frameworks like React and Vue) and render them to high-quality video.

## The Fastest Way to Start

The quickest way to get started is by cloning one of our examples.

### Using an Example

1.  Clone the repository (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/helios-project/helios.git
    cd helios
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Run the React example:
    ```bash
    npm run dev:react-dom
    ```
    Open your browser to the URL shown (usually `http://localhost:5173/composition.html`).
