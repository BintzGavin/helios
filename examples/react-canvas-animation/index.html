  <h1>Helios React Demo</h1>

  <!--
    The player loads the composition.
    In this case, the composition is the React app itself, but we need to point to an HTML file
    that bootstraps the React app.
    However, standard Vite React apps have `index.html` as the entry.
    Since we are already in `index.html`, we can't load ourselves recursively easily.

    Usually, the 'player' page is separate from the 'composition' page.
    Let's make `composition.html` the entry point for the React App.
  -->
  <helios-player
    src="./composition.html"
    duration="5"
    fps="30">
  </helios-player>

  <script type="module" src="/packages/player/src/index.ts"></script>
